# Debug Logs Directory

This directory contains debug logs generated by the Chromaniac application. Each log file follows the naming pattern:
```
debug_logs_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-mm-ss.txt
```

## Log File Format
Each log entry contains:
- Timestamp: `[YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss]`
- Log Level Emoji:
  - üöÄ Initialization
  - ‚ÑπÔ∏è Info
  - üîç Debug
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning
  - ‚ùå Error
- Message content
- Stack trace (for errors)

## Purpose
These logs help track application state, debug issues, and monitor user interactions. The same logs are also stored in the app's documents directory on the device.

## Retention
Log files are created per app session. You may want to periodically clean up old log files to manage disk space.
